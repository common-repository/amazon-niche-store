The manner in which it interacted with the plugin author's web server created more traffic than the server could handle.  The [Free WordPress Store for Amazon Associates](http://geeklad.com/free-wordpress-store-for-amazon-associates) has been rewritten to minimize the traffic send to the server, while improving the overall visitor experience.  Be sure to check it out.
